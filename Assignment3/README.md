Purpose of the program:
	This program is designed to keep track of occupancy in an auditorium. The seating is in a 2D grid where there are 1,000 rows and each row contains 1,000 seats. 
	If a seat is occupied it is set to 1 otherwise it is empty and set to 0. Customers occupy or leave seats in blocks.
	There are three main operation performed on seats:
	1) Occupy: this sets a given block seat to 1 regardless of whether the seat is already occupied or not.
	2) Empty: This sets a given block of seats to 0 regardless of whether the seat is already empty or not.
	3) Toggle: This toggles the occupancy on a given block of seats.  If seats are empty they are set to occupied and vice versa. 
	4) Number Occupied: This goes through the 2D grid and counts the number of seats that are occupied.

	The answer returned from the program using the data provided was: 400,410
